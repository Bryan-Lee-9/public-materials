Course Selection Advisory Board
===============================

    By Kwangju Kim, Class of 2017

Few tips raised by upperclassmen students to advise other students to choose the appropriate courses to take each semester.

Registration Related Advice
---------------------------

**PLAN EARLY!!!** Typically the next semester's schedule is available in mid-October for spring semester, and before spring break for fall semester.
We are strongly telling you, you won't have an enough time to plan right before your registration starts.
You must plan early, probably before the 2-4 weeks before your registration date.
Take out the piece of paper, write down the courses you want to take, and adjust the schedule so that there shall be no conflicts.
Look for other sections if exists.

**Check your registration time.** You can check your registration ticket at BannerWeb_.
Typically, it starts between 7 AM and 7:30 AM, so you may have to get up early.
Set up the alarm on your registration start date and time.
This is important because if you miss it, your desired courses might be filled up fast, resulting that you have to request force-add.

**See your advisor.** Typically, academic advisors are the primary persons who can help you choose the course, adjust the schedule, or request the force add.
Go to BannerWeb_, print your Degree Audit Report (DAR), bring that to your advisor so that the person can know more about your current academic status.
`Making an appointment <http://meeting.krumpe.com/>`_ with `Norm Krumpe`_ is another good idea.
He is a chief advisor who is responsible for giving advice to current and prospective CSE students.
If you are a first year student, you might or might not have your designated first-year advisor.
If so, it is not a bad idea to talk to them, too.

**Use the appropriate computer.** The registration sends a massive amount of packets to the BannerWeb server.
This also affects your computer's performance.
We strongly recommend you to use Miami libraries' desktop computers.
That is the most reliable option for registration.
Using a laptop over Wi-Fi is not recommended, because of the possibility for connectivity interruption.
Make sure you are using an appropriate web browser which BannerWeb supports.
(We don't expect you are still using IE6, but we just mean you should be prepared.)

**IF YOU ARE AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT**, you are *required by law* to take **more than or equal to** 12 credit hours, which satisfies your **full-time** enrollment requirement.
Failure to register 12 credit hours will affect you negatively.
For more questions regarding this, please send an email to the `International Student Advisors`_.
They can give you *legal* advice to maintain your good status while temporarily staying in the United States.

Typically, there are classes offered in both semesters, and only one semester.
You must plan accordingly so that *you can graduate on time!* Chances are, you have to take one class to graduate but it doesn't offer in the spring semester, then you have to spend one more semester to take that course to get a degree.
We have offered course registration tips for both semesters.
We advise the appropriate courses to pick based on our prior experiences.
